# Josh Parnham's Dotfiles

Based off [Ryan Bates's](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) dotfiles, but (almost) all configuration is my own.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the `rake install` task. It will prompt you before doing anything destructive.

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:josh-/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    rake install
